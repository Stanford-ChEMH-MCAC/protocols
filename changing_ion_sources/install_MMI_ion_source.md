# Overview

This protocol describes how to remove the dual AJS ion source and install the MMI ion source on the shared ChEM-H / GNPN 6545 qTOF mass spectrometer.

# Equipment
#### PPE
Safety glasses and nitrile gloves are required for this protocol.

#### Ion source
* The MMI ion source is typically stored in the top right drawer underneath the mass spectrometer.
* The dual AJS ion source that you plan to remove should be stored in this same drawer after you remove it.  Please put the cover on the dual AJS ion source before storage.

# Protocol
1. Ensure you have reserved time on the appropriate ChEM-H LC-MS schedule:
	* The Agilent 6545 QTOF calendar is at [GNPN ChEM-H LC-MS Schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gnpn.chemh.lc.ms%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)
	* The Agilent 6470 QQQ calendar is at [QQQ_6470](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3eic0r8c6jmtdf9e350dg8cl74%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)
 
2. Cool the installed (dual AJS) ion source.  Turn the qTOF to “Standby”.  Wait for 20 minutes.  WARNING: even after this step, the installed source will still be hot.  Always wear gloves.

3. 	Disconnect electrical cables.  
 
4.	Disconnect *both* liquid capillaries (one from the LC and one from bottle B into the 2nd nebulizer).  Do NOT unscrew the red capillary that leads from the LC stack into the mass spectrometer.  Unscrew the beige capillaries that carry (a) LC effluent and (b) bottle B ions into their respective nebulizers.
 
5.	Disconnect the nebulizer gas connection upstream of the "dual AJS shutoff valve".  There is only single gas connection for both nebulizers.  

6. Remove the sheath gas connection.
 
7.	Remove the installed ion source.  Unlatch the safety lock that holds the ion source in place.  Remove the source and place it in its labeled storage location.
 
8.	Unscrew the installed spray shield. WEAR GLOVES.  The spray shield may be hot.
 
9.	Screw in the spray shield for the MMI source.  The dual AJS electrospray source requires the spray shield with two pointy protrusions.
 
10.	Mount the MMI ion source.  
 
11.	Connect nebulizer gas.  The nebulizer gas line from the MS goes into the dual AJS flow splitting valve “IN” port.
 
12.	Connect the liquid capillary from the LC-MS to the nebulizer.  
 
13.	Close safety latch. The latch should close firmly but not require great force to latch.  Adjust length of locking bolt as required.
 
14.	CHANGE THE CALIBRANT SOLUTION. The MMI source requires its own tuning mix.  Remove the "ESI-L" calibration mix from the “bottle B” position on the front of the mass spectrometer and RETURN IT TO THE REFRIGERATOR.  
 
15.	If necessary, [power cycle the mass spectrometer](power_cycle_MS.md).
	* I have found empirically that power cycling when installing the MMI source is rarely required, but that power cycling when _removing_ the MMI source is almost always required.  
 
16.	Calibrate.
