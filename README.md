# Stanford ChEM-H MCAC Protocols

This repository contains laboratory protocols for operating mass spectrometers in Stanford's ChEM-H Metabolic Chemistry Analysis Center.  The protocols are formatted in markdown (*.md) format for easy manipulation and pretty display on GitHub.

## Organization

This protocol repository is loosely organized into sub-directories.  Sub-directories are currently:

1. The two most frequently used protcols are:

	* [`start_6545_lcms_run_protocol`](start_6545_lcms_run_protocol.md), stored here in the root directory.  This protocol is the most often used document in the repository and is stored in the root directory.  
	* The companion protocol for the 6470 triple quadrupole is [`start_6470_lcms_run_protocol`](start_6470_lcms_run_protocol.md) and it is also in the root directory.

1. [`instrument_maintenace_and_configuration`](instrument_maintenace_and_configuration).  These protocols relate to periodic maintenance, instrument reconfiguration, column cleaning, the composition of the tuning mix etc.

2. [`sample_preparation`](sample_preparation).  These protocols relate to readying samples for LC-MS analysis.

3. [`changing_ion_sources`](changing_ion_sources).  Some of mass spectrometers can be used with multiple ion sources.  Protocols in this directory describe how to swap out one ion source for another.

5. [`installation`](installation).  This directory contains tales of woe and caution related to the installation of mass spectrometers.
