# Stanford ChEM-H MCAC Protocols

This repository contains laboratory protocols for operating mass spectrometers in Stanford's ChEM-H Metabolic Chemistry Analysis Center.  The protocols are formatted in markdown (*.md) format for easy manipulation and pretty display on GitHub.

## Organization

Protocols are loosely organized into sub-directories.

1. The two most commonly used protocols -- for starting runs -- are in the root directory:

	* [`start_6545_lcms_run_protocol`](start_6545_lcms_run_protocol.md).  This protocol is the most often used document in the repository.
	* [`start_6470_lcms_run_protocol`](start_6470_lcms_run_protocol.md) is the companion protocol for the 6470 QQQ MS is 

1. [`instrument_maintenace_and_configuration`](instrument_maintenace_and_configuration) is a subdirectory for protocols on periodic maintenance, instrument reconfiguration, column cleaning, the composition of the tuning mix etc.

2. [`sample_preparation`](sample_preparation) is a subdir for prepping samples.

3. [`changing_ion_sources`](changing_ion_sources) is a subdir for how to swap out one ion source (e.g. dual AJS) for another (e.g. MMI).

5. [`installation`](installation) is a subdir containing tales of woe and caution related to the installation of mass spectrometers.
