# Stanford ChEM-H MCAC Protocols

This repository contains laboratory protocols for operating mass spectrometers in Stanford's ChEM-H Metabolic Chemistry Analysis Center.  The protocols are formatted in markdown (*.md) format for easy manipulation and pretty display on GitHub.

## Organization

This protocol repository is loosely organized into sub-directories.  Sub-directories are currently:

1. [`periodic_maintenance`](periodic_maintenance).  These protocols relate to periodic maintenance, instrument reconfiguration, column cleaning, the composition of the tuning mix etc.

2. [`sample_preparation`](sample_preparation).  These protocols relate to readying samples for LC-MS analysis.

3. [`changing_ion_sources`](changing_ion_sources).  Some of mass spectrometers can be used with multiple ion sources.  Protocols in this directory describe how to swap out one ion source for another.

4. Starting a run.  The most often used protocol in this repository is [`start_6545_lcms_run_protocol`](start_6545_lcms_run_protocol.md), stored here in the root directory.
