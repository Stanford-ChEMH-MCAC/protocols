# Overview

This protocol describes how to remove the MMI ion source and install the dual AJS ESI  ion source on the shared ChEM-H / GNPN 6545 qTOF mass spectrometer.

# Equipment
#### PPE
Safety glasses and nitrile gloves are required for this protocol.

#### Ion source
* The dual AJS ion source is typically stored in the top right drawer underneath the mass spectrometer.
* The MMI ion source that you plan to remove should be stored in this same drawer after you remove it.  Please put the cover on the MMI ion source before storage.

# Protocol
1. Ensure you have reserved time on the appropriate ChEM-H LC-MS schedule:
	* The Agilent 6545 QTOF calendar is at [GNPN ChEM-H LC-MS Schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gnpn.chemh.lc.ms%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)
	* The Agilent 6470 QQQ calendar is at [QQQ_6470](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3eic0r8c6jmtdf9e350dg8cl74%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)
 
2. Cool the installed (MMI) ion source.  Turn the qTOF to “Standby”.  Wait for 20 minutes.  WARNING: even after this step, the installed source will still be hot.  Always wear gloves.

3. 	Disconnect electrical cables.  
 
4.	Disconnect the LC capillary.  Do NOT unscrew the red capillary that leads from the LC stack into the mass spectrometer.  Unscrew the beige capillary that carries LC effluent from the mass spec diverter valve into the nebulizer.
 
5.	Disconnect nebulizer gas connection.  
 
6.	Remove the installed ion source.  Unlatch the safety lock that holds the ion source in place.  Remove the source and place it in its labeled storage location.
 
7.	Unscrew the installed spray shield. WEAR GLOVES.  The spray shield may be hot.
 
8.	Screw in the spray shield for the dual AJS source.  The dual AJS electrospray source requires the ROUND spray shield.
 
9.	Mount the dual AJS source.  
 
10.	Connect nebulizer gas.  The nebulizer gas line from the MS goes into the dual AJS flow splitting valve “IN” port.
 
11.	Connect the sheath gas.  Uncap the sheath gas line and screw it into the union and attached gas tubing on the dual AJS source.  
 
12.	Connect BOTH liquid capillaries.  Connect the beige LC capillary from the mass spectrometer to the upward-facing nebulizer on top of the instrument.  Connect the reference mass nebulizer to the diagonal nebulizer.
 
13.	Close safety latch. The latch should close firmly but not require great force to latch.  Adjust length of locking bolt as required.
 
14.	CHANGE THE CALIBRANT SOLUTION. The dual AJS source requires a 10x-diluted low-concentration ESI tuning mix.  Remove the MMI calibration mix from the “bottle B” position on the front of the mass spectrometer and RETURN IT TO THE REFRIGERATOR.  
 
15.	15.	If necessary, [power cycle the mass spectrometer](power_cycle_MS.md).
 
16.	Calibrate.
