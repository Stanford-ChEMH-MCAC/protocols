# Overview

This protocol describes how to filter samples in a high-throughput manner.  Filtration is a necessary sample processing step prior to LC, HPLC, or UPLC analyses, to prevent clogging of autoinjector lines and UPLC columns.  This protocol is geared towards users of [ChEM-H's 6545 Q-TOF mass spectrometer](https://asconfluence.stanford.edu/confluence/display/ICB/ChEM-H+Metabolic+Chemistry+Analysis+Center), and is geared for processing large numbers (> 20) of samples at once.  

# Equipment
### Samples

Samples for this protocol are assumed to be one of two types:

1. Clarified aqueous samples
	* Examples: the clarified supernatant of yeast cultures in rich, semi-rich, or minimal medium (i.e. the culture has been centrifuged and the clear supernatants transfered to their own containers); similar cultures of bacteria, mammalian cells, etc.
2. Samples that are the dried/evaporated/lyophilized residue of organic solvent extracts of biological samples
	* Examples: yeast cell pellets that are extracted with 1:1 v:v mixtures of ethyl acetate/acetone and dried by vacuum centrifugation, plant tissue that is extracted with 80% v/v methanol in water and dried under nitrogen, etc.

### Filters
* MultiScreen Solvinert Filter Plates, 0.45 &mu;m Low-Binding Hydrophilic PTFE ([Merck Millipore #MSRLN0410](https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/MultiScreen-Solvinert-Filter-Plate,-hydrophilic,-PTFE,-0.45%C2%A0%C2%B5m,-clear,-non-sterile,MM_NF-MSRLN0410))
	* If these _hydrophilic_ filter plates are unavailable **and** your samples are in organic solvents (e.g. 100% methanol), _then_ Hydrophobic PTFE filter plates (e.g. [Merck Millipore # MSRPN0410](https://www.emdmillipore.com/CA/en/product/MultiScreen-Solvinert-Filter-Plate,-hydrophobic,-PTFE,-0.45%C2%A0%C2%B5m,-clear,-non-sterile,MM_NF-MSRPN0450) are acceptable substitutes.
	* We have found that non-PTFE plates, even those marketed as solvent-compatible and for use in HPLC sample prep, introduce far more contaminants into the samples.
	* Even the PTFE filter plates contain contaminants; to remove them, they must be pre-rinsed with methanol.
	

### 96-well plates and covers

* Polypropylene 96-well deep-well plates, 1 mL ([Agilent #5042-6454](http://www.agilent.com/store/en_US/Prod-5042-6454/5042-6454))

* Silicone closing mats for 96-well plates ([Agilent #5042-1389](http://www.agilent.com/store/en_US/Prod-5042-1389/5042-1389))


### Instrumentation

* centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor capable of containing your plates is required.
* multichannel pipettes and tips

### Reagents

HPLC-grade methanol

# Protocol (clarified aqueous samples)
1. If required, allow your clarified aqueous samples to thaw.
2. Wash your filter plates with methanol to remove contaminants from the filter.
	1. Dispense ~100 mL of methanol into a glass container with an opening wide enough for your multichannel pipette to reach inside.
	2. Add 200 &mu;L of methanol to each well of a filter plate
	3. Put your filter plate above a 96-well plate (this catch plate is just to prevent methanol from being eluted onto the centrifuge rotor and can be of any type).
	4. Spin the filter plate at 2 min for 2500 rpm to force methanol through the filter, removing the contaminants on the filter.
3. Label your plates
	1. For each filter plate that you will use, label an Agilent deep-well 96-well polypropylene plate with your name, date, and other identifying information (e.g. plate #, experiment #, etc.).  These plates are the "catch" plates that hold your samples after filtration; they will be the "permanent" home of your samples during and after instrumental analysis.
	2. Using a Sharpie pen, label the top of each filter plate so that you can match filter plates to the appropriate catch plate.
4. Add samples to the washed filter plate.	
	1. Position each filter plate over the corresponding catch plate.  Ensure the orientation of the filter plate is the same as the catch plate.
	2. Using a multichannel pipettor, mix your samples by aspiration.  (I.e., pipette up and down several times.)  This ensures that any particles that may have formed during freezing or thawing are evenly distrubted in your samples
	3. Transfer 200 &mu;L of your samples to the filter plate.
	4. Cover the filter plate with a lid.
5. Centrifuge the filter plate and catch plate stack to filter your samples.
	1. Put your plate stack into a swinging bucket centrifuge.
		* Ensure your plates are balanced.  Do not pile more than one filter plate/catch plate stack on top of each other.
	2. Spin at 2500 rpm for 2 minutes.
		* Verify that all the sample volume has been pulled through the filter and is in the catch plate.  If sample remains above the filter, centrifuge again.
6.  Cover the catch plate with a silicone sealing mat.  Discard filter plates.
